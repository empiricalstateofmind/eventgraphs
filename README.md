#### Features:

1. Building the temporal event graph (static representation of a temporal network)
2. Calculating temporal motifs (with arbitrary number of events)
3. Inter-event time distributions
4. Motif distributions
5. Network decompositions into temporal components
6. Saving/Loading functionality
